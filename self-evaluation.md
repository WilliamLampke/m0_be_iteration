# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
''' decent its actually a pretty nice way to iterate also! '''
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
''' No tbh I grinded some coding courses to prepare so this wasn't that bad '''
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
''' Not much just learning syntax and continue taking notes so I can go back. '''
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
''' As always smallgroup/google! '''
